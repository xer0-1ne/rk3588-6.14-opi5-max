# This is a work in progress.  

I am attempting to build / update the dtb and kernel 6.14 for the Orange Pi 5 Max (rk3588).  

I have been using previous versions of the orangepi-5-max device trees to apply the missing hardware links for the 6.14 dtb.  This should enable the hardware to function properly (wifi, bt, hdmi with sound, etc.).
